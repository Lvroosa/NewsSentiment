# NewsSentiment

NOTE: This is a work in progress. There is also a current limit of 100 news stories per request, and stories only go as far back as a month from now.

For my internship with Tulane Enterprise Risk Services, one of my goals was to track the sentiment of news articles related to Tulane. My streamlit application implements News API to find the articles and Gemini's API to analyze the sentiment of the articles in relation to the keyword.

If you would like to interact with the application, you can do so right here: https://news-sentiment.streamlit.app/
